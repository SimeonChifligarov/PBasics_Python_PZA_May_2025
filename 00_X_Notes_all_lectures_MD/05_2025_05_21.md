## 🔁 `while` Loop Mechanics

The `while` loop repeats **as long as a condition is true**.

### 🔢 Steps:

1. **Initialization**  
2. **Condition check**  
3. **Logic + condition update**

```python
counter = 0                     # 1. initialization
while counter < 5:              # 2. condition
    print(counter)
    counter += 1                # 3. update
```

> ⚠️ Without the update, the loop may never end!

---

## 🔁 Example with `break` and `continue`

```python
value = 0
while value < 10:
    value += 1

    if value == 5:
        break        # exits the loop immediately

    if value % 2 == 0:
        continue     # skips to the next loop iteration

    print(value)
```

### Key Notes:
- `break`: stop loop completely  
- `continue`: skip rest of current iteration  
- ✅ Always **update condition before `continue`**

---

## 🧠 Infinite Loops

```python
while True:
    ...
```

Used when loop should run **until an internal condition is met**.

---

## 🏁 Goal-Based Looping

```python
is_goal_achieved = False

while not is_goal_achieved:
    # do stuff
    if some_condition:
        is_goal_achieved = True
```

> 🎯 Keep looping until your goal is achieved. Works well for menu loops, game loops, etc.

---

## 📐 `while-else` Construct

Similar to `for-else`, the `else` runs **only if the loop ends without `break`**.

```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
    if x == 3:
        break
    x += 1
else:
    print("Finished without break")
```

---

## 🧱 Complex Conditions

Python supports chaining logic in conditions:

```python
while cond1 and cond2 and not cond3:
    do_something()
```

> 💡 You can use parentheses to control evaluation order

---

## 🧼 DRY Principle

**DRY = Don’t Repeat Yourself**

- Avoid duplicate code inside loops  
- Extract repeated logic into functions or clearly structured blocks  
- Improves maintainability and reduces bugs

## 🧩 Practice Questions

### Q1: What does this output?

```python
i = 0
while i < 3:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

- a) 0 1 2 ✅  
- b) 1 2 3  
- c) Infinite loop  
- d) Error

---

### Q2: Which statement stops a `while` loop?

- a) `return`  
- b) `exit()`  
- c) `break` ✅  
- d) `continue`

---

### Q3: What happens if you forget to change the condition in a `while` loop?

- a) Syntax error  
- b) The loop runs once  
- c) The loop runs forever ✅  
- d) Python fixes it automatically

---

### Q4: Fix this logic to print only odd numbers below 6:

```python
n = 0
while n < 6:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        n += 1
        continue
    print(n)
    n += 1
```

✅ Already correct! It skips even numbers.

---

### Q5: What’s the purpose of this loop?

```python
while True:
    response = input("Type 'exit' to stop: ")
    if response == "exit":
        break
```

- a) Loop forever  
- b) Loop until user types `exit` ✅  
- c) Print something  
- d) Error
